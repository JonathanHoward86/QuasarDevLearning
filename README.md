# Quasar App (quasar-project)

This is my new Quasar Development Project. I've only been coding for a few months and I'm using GPT to help me learn.

Inside of the src folder you'll find my Pages and Routes

In the router folder and Routes.js you'll find the routes I use for my pages and layout

My mainlayout is inside the layouts folder

and my Forms / Tables / Tasks tabs are in their respective files under the pages folder

My Webpage file is the main page file that holds the tabs referenced above.
